This is based on a setup using streamlabs OBS prime with Chatbox widget source.

If you don't use streamlabs, you will need to find a chatbox source that allows you to edit the html and css.


Streamlabs.com
Log into streamlabs using a web browser.
Navigate to the chat widget.
(https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/chatbox)

Scroll down to replace the entire html contents with the entire contents from the 'chatbox-perspective-html.txt' file.
replace the entire html contents with the entire contents from the 'chatbox-perspective-css.txt' file.

save it.
test it.

Pop into the discord (above) for more advice.
